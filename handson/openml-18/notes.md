C. Need to select number of leaf clusters
Q. Can good values for number of leaf clusters be inferred from the pre-clustered leaf values?

Try to measure the RMSE/MAE of cluster values wrt "perfect" single-class values. 1.0 0.0 1.0
Also measure the RMSE/MAE after clustering?
Plot error metrics vs performance reduction, for the various n leaf clusters
