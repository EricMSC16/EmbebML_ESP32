# Dataset

## Data collection

One hardware is in place.
Make a dataset. Vary

- Heartrate

### Co-variates 

- Placement on finger
- Which finger
- Person
- Ambient light
- Ambient temperature
- Skin moisture
- Skin temperature

What if one would vary the sensor construction also.
Is it realistic to have an universal model?

Note that it is normal to have some variation between beats.
Termed. Heartrate Variability

### Labeling

Can hold finger to throat, and tap the pulse.
For example on a capacitive input!
Record this on Arduino as the label track.

Also exists simple I2C chips that can be used to get BPM programatically.
Like MAX30100.
