## Ideas

### 1 Dollar TinyML
Section: Innovation Showcase

Those familiar with TinyML may know that there is a lot one can do with a 1 dollar microcontroller.

1 dollar gets you

STM32F072 with 16 kB RAM and 64 kB FLASH. USB
STM32F030 with 32 kB RAM and 256 kB FLASH
RP2040 with 256 kB RAM and 4 MB FLASH. 133 Mhz

But what if the entire system should cost under 1 dollar?
Is it possible? What are the limitations?
What implications does this have over the coming years?
What will the impact become?


### emlearn 5 years
Impact Across Industries / 

- emlearn impact over.
Portable classical methods for microcontrollers
A scikit-learn for microcontrollers
Impact via papers written about it

IDEA: invite authors to provide more details.
Stories. Images. Videos. Funny,anecdotal
Basically anything that goes.
