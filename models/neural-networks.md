Convolutional Neural Networks.

Much more compact models than fully connected for spatial-patterns.


* [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/).
Explains FC->CONV equivalence, Layer Sizing Patterns,
Generally early layers have few kernels, many pixels (generic features).
Late layers many kernels, few pixels (specific features).
A fully connected (FC) layer can be converted to a CONV layer.
This allows to reduce the number of passes needed over the input,
which is more computationally effective.
Several layers of small kernels (3x3) is more expressive than bigger kernel (7x7),
because they can combine in non-linear ways thanks to activation functions.
Also requires less parameters.

Optimizing CNNs

* [convolution-flavors](https://github.com/gplhegde/convolution-flavors).
Kernel to Row an Kernel to Column tricks save memory.
Also has Vectored Convolution, 1D Winograd Convolution are computationally faster.
* ResNet use stride instead of pooling layers to reduce size. Less computations?
* Grouped convolutions. Not convolving (output of) entire past layers, but just subsets.
Allows to eliminate redundant computations.
https://github.com/ShichenLiu/CondenseNet - approx twice as efficient as MobileNets

### Kernel dictionaries

Use a fixed set of kernels in a CNN or convolutional feature-map extractor.
Store their index instead of individual weights?
To reduce weight storage size for big networks.

Kernel weights 3x3 @ 8 bit = 72 bits.
Kernel map index: 32-256kernels: 5-8 bit.
Approx factor 10x reduction.

Can be done using vector quantization or clustering on the CNN weights.

Approximate the separable kernels from non-separable ones using SVD.
Separable. For a K x K filter, the count of weights is reduced from K*K to K+K and the speedup is (K**K)/2K.

### Transfer learning
* DeCAF: A deep convolutional activation feature for generic visual recognition.
DeCAF layers taken from a general task, plus SVM/LogisticRegression training outperform existing state-of-the-art.
* CNN features off the shelf: an astounding baseline for recognition. Pre-trained CNN plus SVM.
"SIFT and HOG descriptors produced big performance gains a decade ago
and now deep convolutional features are providing a similar breakthrough for recognition"
"In any case, if you develop any new algorithm for a recognition task,
it **must** be compared against the strong baseline of generic deep features + simple classifier"

Could one try well-known normalized kernels, instead of learning them?
Ex: Sobel edge detectors, median/gaussian averaging etc.

Could it give performance benefits to flatten a deep model?
Ie use a deep model, compute typical activations for the different layers,
mimick these flat convolutional kernels. Teacher-student type learning.

### Other kernel learning methods
Could one learn CNN kernels using greedy selection of sets of N kernels?

Layer-wise greedy learning can be done. Can be unsupervised or supervised.
Goes back to Y Bengio, 2007. Not so popular in 2015, after ReLu etc improved.
Can still be beneficial for datasets with small amount of labeled samples.
[1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/232616/is-greedy-layer-wise-training-of-deep-networks-necessary-for-successfully-traini)
Especially unsupervised pre-training/initialization, with supervised fine-tuning using back-propagation.
Stacked Autoencoders is one approach. [1](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Stacked_Autoencoders)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to learn convolution kernels as the pre-training strategy.

### Model compression

* [Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJGCiw5gl&noteId=SJGCiw5gl). ICLR 2017. Prunin criterion based on Taylor expansion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters.
Focus on transfer learning. Pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks.
Demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation.
* [Structural Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks Based on Greedy Filter Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07356).
* "Compressing Convolutional Neural Networks in the Frequency Domain". Wenlin Chen.
Called FreshNets. Uses HashedNets for FC parts. Evaluated at 1/16 and 1/64 compression.
* [CNNpack: Packing Convolutional Neural Networks in the Frequency Domain](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6390-cnnpack-packing-convolutional-neural-networks-in-the-frequency-domain.pdf). Yunhe Wang. NIPS 2016. 41 citations.
Treat convolutional kernels as images. Decompose each kernel into common parts (ie cluster centers),
and residual (unique to the kernel).
A large number of **low-energy frequency coefficients** in both parts can be discarded to
produce high compression without significantly compromising accuracy.
Relax the computational burden of convolution operations in CNNs by linearly
combining the convolution responses of discrete cosine transform (DCT) bases.
Method: kernel coefficients -> DCT -> k-means clustering -> l1 shrinkage -> quantization -> Huffman -> Compressed Sparse Row.
For similar performance, 30-40x compression on AlexNet/VGG16, 10-25x speedup. 13x compression on ResNet50. !!

### Neural Architecture Search
For embedded almost always interested in performance under constraints,
on RAM, FLASH and CPU time / energy usage.
Of interest is to find Pareto-optimal (family of) models,
which offers the best performance/constraint tradeoff.

#### On Random Weights and Unsupervised Feature Learning
NIPS 2010.

In this paper we pose the question, why do random weights sometimes do so well?
Our answer is that certain convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently
frequency selective and translation invariant, even with random weights.
Demonstrate the viability of extremely fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures,
thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. Process is approximately 30x faster.

Methods include k-NN, HMM, SVM, GMM and deep neural networks.
For each of the methods covers some optimization schemes.

For SVM concludes that the Laplacian kernel is the most efficient, since it can be implemented with shifts.
Laplacian kernel can be used in scikit-learn by precomputing the kernel.
On a practical level the number of support vectors also impact runtime.
In scikit-learn can use the NuSVC model to constrain the number of support vectors.
