# TODO

- Create project on HackADay.
Should have 1-2 pictures. Concept. System diagram? BOM.
Add a small introduction post
- Add a link to the main README in embeddedml
- Create HackAday post on sub-dollar microcontrollers
- Make mockup/concept sketch/image for use as sound sensor.
With USB PSU? Check approximate dimensions for board
- Create post on tree-based models.
- Finish initial schematic
- Create post on RNN models
- Get Holtek BLE PoC working
- Create post on holbeacon
- Setup app code skeleton, for checking prog/RAM sizes. Especially FFT

# DONE

- Initial research on microcontrollers,
- Theoretical check that RNN can fit into 2 kB RAM / 32 kB RAM.
Confirmed. FastGRNN etc.
