# Carbon rod microphone
The carbon rod microphone was one of the first designs.
Predates the carbon granula "button" microphone.

Principle: The loose contact between two objects is suc
Carbon is practical because it does not oxidice,
and provices an inherent resistance.

## Ideas

?? could one use a pencil, and just sharpen it in both ends with pencil sharpener?
Alternatively a pure graphite / charcol pencil, found in art supply stores

#### Simplifier: Compoud, high quality wooden microphone
https://simplifier.neocities.org/compound
Speech sounds pretty good! Clear and OK frequency balance. A bit boxy/resonant.
Uses a thin wood sheet as a diaphram.
Uses 4 carbon rods suspeneded between 2 carbon terminals.
Rods are connected 2 in series, 2 in parallell.

! Good contender for making a 3d-printed replica.

Uses grafite powder.
Two plastic cups to put it in between.
Conductive aluminium tape for leads.

# Button microphone

Invented around 1920.

Used activated charcoal granulas as a base.
Ground it into finer powder using a hammer and filtered with a metal mesh.

A comparison with an original metal double button carbon microphone is performed.
Works, but sound quality is not that great.
Author provides a number of areas that improvements can target.

# Matchbox microphone

Many videos showing this on Youtube.
Sound quality tends to be pretty bad however.
Thin 0.5mm rods do not work - need a grafite stick from pencil.
Many recommend sanding the connecting surfaces flat.
Some just let the top electrode lie on top of the others - cannot be moved around.
Others led the top be tensioned slightly across the others - can be moved.
