Used differentiable NAS (DNAS) (Liu et al., 2019) to design specialized MCU models to target
TinyMLperf tasks.

Keyword spotting, Acoustic Anomaly Detection (DCASE2020 Task2)

Models, but not training, published to https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-zoo

Designed for execution with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers.
