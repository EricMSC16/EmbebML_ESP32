## Title
HVAC monitoring in commercial buildings using anomaly detection

## Abstract

There are millions of commercial buildings in the world, from offices, to schools, hospitals and stores.
Most of these are fitted with heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems,
in order to provide a productive and comfortable indoor climate.
As with all electromechanical systems, HVAC systems are subject to breakdowns
and must be maintained in order to keep them functional.
The most common strategy is time-based inspections by the building operations personnel and HVAC service providers.
This labor-intensive approach is costly, but many failures still slip by because they happen between inspection intervals.

In early 2022, Soundsensing started to deploy condition monitoring to HVAC systems in commercial buildings.
The solution uses vibration- and sound-sensors to monitor rotating equipment in these systems.
We find that the system is able to provide early-warning for many mechanical issues,
enabling operations teams to schedule maintenance before the system goes down.
Furthermore, we find that many systems repeatedly have problems with running when they should not,
or not running when they should - and that most of the buildings lack Building Management Systems
that accurately detect these issues.
Both of these failure modes are monitored using an Anomaly Detection approach,
and combined, the system provides both cost savings and lower downtime.
