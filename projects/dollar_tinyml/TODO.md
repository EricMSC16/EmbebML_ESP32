# TODO

- Create 1 or 2 project images
- Add a link to the main README in embeddedml
- Create HackAday post on sub-dollar microcontrollers
- Check approximate dimensions for board.
Want to be smaller than 40x40 mm
- Make mockup/concept sketch/image for use as wristband
- Create post on tree-based models.
- Finish initial schematic
- Get Holtek BLE PoC working
- Create post on holbeacon
- Make mockup/concept sketch/image for use as sound sensor. With USB PSU?
- Setup app code skeleton, for checking prog/RAM sizes. Especially FFT
- Create post on RNN models
- Maybe order a devboard

# DONE

- Initial research on microcontrollers,
- Theoretical check that RNN can fit into 2 kB RAM / 32 kB FLASH.
Confirmed. FastGRNN etc.
- Theoretical check that RF for HAR can fit into 2kB RAM / 32 kB FLASH
