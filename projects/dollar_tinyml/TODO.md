# TODO

- Create 1 or 2 project images
- Add a link to the main README in embeddedml
- Make mockup/concept sketch/image for use as wristband
- Get Holtek BLE PoC working
- Create post on holbeacon
- Make mockup/concept sketch/image for use as sound sensor. With USB PSU?
- Setup app code skeleton, for checking prog/RAM sizes. Especially FFT
- Create post on Sound Event Detection with Recurrent Neural Networks
- Maybe order a devboard

### Hardware

dml10 rev1

- Make a proper PCB outline. Round corners, dog/tbones for USB stickout. In FreeCAD
- Make a concept for casing. In FreeCAD. With USB charger.
- Get quote. At JLCPCB

# DONE

- Initial research on microcontrollers,
- Theoretical check that RNN can fit into 2 kB RAM / 32 kB FLASH.
Confirmed. FastGRNN etc.
- Theoretical check that RF for HAR can fit into 2kB RAM / 32 kB FLASH
- Hyperparameter tuning RF for small size, for HAR on PAMAP2 dataset
- Post on HAR+RF feasibility
- Check approximate dimensions for board. Currently 52x26mm incl USB connector, 40x26mm excluding
