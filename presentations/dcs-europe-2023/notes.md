### What can we do with 1 USD?

RTX3090. Approx 1000 USD

What can one get for 1 USD?
Assuming 1k volumes.

#### Microcontroller

Can get a pretty modern microcontroller.

- 1x RP2040 chip. Cortex M0+
- ATTiny with 4KB FLASH / 512 bytes RAM + 3-axis I2C accelerometer
- STM32G030F6P6 0.30 USD 32 kB FLASH / 8 kB RAM.
With USB!
0.2 mA in LPRUN 2Mhz
5 uA in STOP 1 no SRAM retention with RTC.

China MCU 16KB 512Byte at 0.25 USD
China MCU 8KB 1.25KB at 0.15 USD

### Sensors
Prices from JLCPCB

- MEMS microphones <0.2 USD
- Photointerruptor 0.1 USD
- LIS2DH12TR accelerometer. 0.3 USD

### Power

Consumable battery

- CR1216 battery at 0.2 USD
- CR2477 0.8 USD @ 1k

Rechargable battery

- LIR1220 0.2 USD @ 1k. 7 mAh
- Battery charger 0.06 USD @ 1k
 

### System-view

Could one build an entire application?
Challenge: Power, communication


#### A health wristband
With Human Activity Recognition and pulse monitoring.
Logging to internal FLASH, USB connectivity.

- XySemi XC5011 charger
- Everlight Elec ITR8307/S17/TR8(B)
- STMicroelectronics STM32G030F6P6
- STMicroelectronics LIS2DH12TR
- LIR1220 battery

Total BOM: < 1.0 USD @ 1k

7 mAh / 24 hour = 0.29 mA average consumption.

#### IoT sensor
BLE beacon

NRF52 with accelerometer.
HolyIoT or similar.
7 USD @ 1
5 USD @ 1k

Not yet 1 USD. But << 10 USD.

Sensors 100x 7 = 700
IoT gateway. 100 USD.

Conclusion:
One can get system with 100 ML-enabled sensors for price of 1 RTX3090

But 16 kB RAM and 192 kB FLASH.
How to run ML on this?
And what is feasible vs infeasible?
