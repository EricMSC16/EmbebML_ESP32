## Datasets

### Gunshot/Gunfire Audio Dataset
https://zenodo.org/record/7004819
July 14, 2022

Audio recordings of four different types of firearms, each shot with three different firing styles.
The recordings contained within this dataset have been cropped from the original recordings for ease of use.
The original recordings often contained files where gunshots would be separated by several of minutes of background noise.
To avoid users having to extract the relevant sections themselves, each original recording was broken up into clips using
a method that ensured that every 2 seconds of audio contained at least one gunshot.
For more information on how this was performed, see the Preprocessing section of the paper.

The created database is appropriate for developing methods of automatic gunshot detection from continuous audio signals that are suitable for implementation in low power remote monitoring systems.

Availability unclear
