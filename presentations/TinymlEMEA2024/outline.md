## Goals

- Shine positively on Soundsensing.
Mention at least 2 times in talk. Intro + case.
Also tie in EARONEDGE project
- Establish emlearn as a serious project
Relevance. Usefulness.
Core values. Tiny models, easy-to-use, efficient (compute/power)

## Format

20-25 minutes + 5 minutes QA.

2x sessions between 10:50 am to 11:40
https://www.tinyml.org/event/emea-2024/

## Audience

Expecting mostly TinyML practitioners and technologists.

- ML engineers. With embedded/sensors background mostly?
- ML researchers. Academic and industry. Core and applied.
- ML/DS team/tech leads. 
- CTOs. 

Focus: Practical, technical.
Voicing: Concrete. Substantiated.

### What we promised

- showcase a selection usecases, and discuss their impact
- latest improvements in emlearn
Optimized decision tree ensembles, native support for MicroPython

## Talking points

- "A scikit-learn for microcontrollers"
Established methods.
Some relevant surrounding tooling

- Decision trees are very powerful and efficient
REF. Papers showing more efficient than DL. HAR
Comparison with emlearn 2019 ?

- emlearn has most efficient decision trees out there
REF. Benchmarks vs other alternatives. TODO: make benchmark

- emlearn is used in real-world project
REF. papers applying it. Select 2-3. TODO: reach out to authors

- emlearn + MicroPython enables pure-Python TinyML applications
Very convenient. Just mip install it
CLAIM. Can do accel / sound / image
TODO: CNN support. tinymaix_cnn
