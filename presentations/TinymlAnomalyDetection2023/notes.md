## Title
HVAC monitoring in commercial buildings using anomaly detection

## Abstract

There are millions of commercial buildings in the world, from offices, to schools, hospitals and stores.
Most of these are fitted with heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems,
in order to provide a productive and comfortable indoor climate.
As with all electromechanical systems, HVAC systems are subject to breakdowns
and must be maintained in order to keep them functional.
The most common strategy is time-based inspections by the building operations personnel and HVAC service providers.
This labor-intensive approach is costly, but many failures still slip by because they happen between inspection intervals.

In early 2022, Soundsensing started to deploy condition monitoring to HVAC systems in commercial buildings.
The solution uses vibration- and sound-sensors to monitor rotating equipment in these systems.
We find that the system is able to provide early-warning for many mechanical issues,
enabling operations teams to schedule maintenance before the system goes down.
Furthermore, we find that many systems repeatedly have problems with running when they should not,
or not running when they should - and that most of the buildings lack Building Management Systems
that accurately detect these issues.
Both of these failure modes are monitored using an Anomaly Detection approach,
and combined, the system provides both cost savings and lower downtime.


## Format

10 min for your presentation

5-10 slides

We look for technical value, use case and no corporate marketing please.

## Take aways

Condition Monitoring is valuable for HVAC systems
    +   mechanical 
Vibration monitoring

Soundsensing has a mature solution
    + Already used by many buildings


## Learnings

Many buildings do not have Building Management System
    some do not have remote access
Many Building Management Systems do not have proper feedback
    - control systems assume success
    - missing/incorrect configuration of alarms

Even the most recent BMS do not have anything for mechanical failures

Manual inspections the main strategy
    By operations team. Possibly weekly. 
        ! tends to get down-prioritized at busy times

Vibration monitoring not widely deployed

High percentage of buildings
Last converted from fixed function during 2022.
Unusually high energy prices in Norway - have already been the norm many other countries

Control issues is a real problem in many buildings

Teams often manage multiple buildings
Buildings have different equipments
Want a unified solution

Have existing work order systems.
Professional organizations are on a track to use these for all work
Integration of CM systems highly desirable

Run to failure is standard
Low cost of failure - compared to industry

Building operators are not interested in configuring or setting up tech themselves,
or to pay for very costly integrations.
They want to buy fully-operational technology

## Goals

Reduce manual 
Catch errors before failure

## Timeline

Q2 2020 - student project
Q4 2021 - PoC testing

Q3 2022 - 
    NN buildings
