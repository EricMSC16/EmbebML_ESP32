#### Abstract

emlearn is an open-source Python library that allows converting scikit-learn and Keras models to efficient C code.
The goal of the project is to make it easy to deploy efficient models to any microcontroller with a C99 compiler,
while keeping Python-based workflow that is familiar to Machine Learning Engineers.
The project was first released in 2018, predating many other TinyML libraries.
Over the years the library has been used in a wide range of applications,
from detection of vechicles in acoustic sensor nodes,
to tracking welbeing of grazing cows using accelerometers,
to hand gesture recognition based on sEMG data,
to real-time malware detection in Android devices.
In this presentation we will showcase a selection usecases and discuss their impact.
We will also cover some of the latest improvements,
such as optimized decision tree ensembles, and native support for MicroPython.
