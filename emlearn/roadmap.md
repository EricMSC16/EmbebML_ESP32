# Roadmap

## Next

Support for the standard tasks,
classification, regression and outlier/anomaly detection.

Demos

- Color detector

Documentation

- Task pages. Classification/regression/anomaly

## 0.5 - Event Detection

Models

- Support proba with trees

Preprocessing

- SignalWindower

Documentation

- Small reference for each model family.

Examples

- SignalWindower. Time-based features.
- Mel-spectrogram. Using SignalWindower
- Signal. LAF soundlevel. Using IIR filters

Demos

- ? Heartrate detector
- Impulse sound detector

## 1.0 - complete broad support

Support the full width of common models.

Models

- linear. Linear regression
- linear. Logistic regression
- neighbour. kNN
- neighbour. Nearest centroid 
- kernel. SVM regression
- kernel. SVM classification
- kernel. One-class SVM
- net. MLP autoencoder
- trees. IsolationForest


## 1.2 - optimized models

Fixed-point support for all models.

- trees. Optimized RF inference

Benchmarking

- Tool for 

## 2.0 - on-device learning


? micropython


## Later

- Streaming stats/summaries
- DTW / Gesture detection
