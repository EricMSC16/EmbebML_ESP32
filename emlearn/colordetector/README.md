# TODO

First PoC

- Do another round of data collection. Check repeatability
- Train a classification model for cards
- Deploy model to device, test it
- Add logging of predictions

Object detector demo

- Print and use 3-led version
- Get some fun colored object
- Collect data and train model
- Make a demo video

## Later

- Design a PCB and send to manufacturing
Support both throughhole components and SMD
5mm LEDs / SMD LEDs (1206 ?)
Using Arduino shield form factor?
Maybe have pieces that can be cutout to act as distace meters
