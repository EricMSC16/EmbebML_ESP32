## Energy budgets

Scenarios

* Constantly on wired power
* Periodically used on battery, else plugged in
* Always/normally battery powered
* Energy harvesting. Never connected to charger, should run forever

### Energy harvesting

Energy harvesting rules of thumb:

    Outdoor light – 10mW/cm2
    Industrial temperature difference – 1-10 mW/cm2

    Industrial vibration – 100µW/cm2
    Human temperature difference – 25µW/cm2
    Indoor light – 10µW/cm2
    Human vibration – 4µW/cm2

    GSM RF – 0.1µW/cm2
    Wifi RF – 0.001µW/cm2
