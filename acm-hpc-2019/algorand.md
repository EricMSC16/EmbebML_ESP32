### Turing Leture
July 20.
Silvio Micali.

Blockchain.
So far. A lot of promises.
Blockchain trilemma. Scalability. Decentralization. Security. Not acceptable.
Fortunately it is false?

Unalterable. One-way hash. Solved.
Chosing the next block. Consensus. Hard question.
Propagation. Flooding algortihm. 

Popular approaches

- Proof of work. Bitcoin. Ethereum.
- Delegated proof of stake.
- Bonded proof of stake.

### Delegated proof of stake
A special group people that stake money gets to decide.
Say 21 people.

### Bonded proof of stake
As many people as possible can participate.
Weight of vote proportional to how much your put in.
Hard for everyday people. Easy for big thieves.


### Pure proof of stage
No money is at hostage.

Consensus via Byzantine Agreement.
Assuming a honest majority.
Adverserial setting.

How to determine how many actors there are?
Aka how many needed for majority.

Byzantine Agreement is very slow.
Only up to 12 players considered.
Only has fixed number of participants.

Algorand.
Have a world-scalable Byzantine Agreement.

Cannot have forks.
Because not possible to agree on second derivative block.
Avoids having to wait for blocks to be "stable".

Random choice of who gets to propose next block.
Then 1k randomly chosen gets to validate this block.


Is the agreement partners published?
DoS attack those.

How to limit number of participants I can have?
MiraBot.

How does a node know its neighbours?
